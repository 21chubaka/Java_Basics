/* - Program to Return the Minimum Runway Length when Given Speed, Acceleration, and Condition (Wet or Dry) -
Inform the user of the rules of the program
Create scanners for speed, acceleration, and condition
Check if the condition is not valid
    If so:
        Inform the user of the mistake
    If not:
        Check if the condition is wet
            If so:
                Calculate the runway length with 15% increase
            If not:
                Calculate the runway length with dry conditions
Close the scanners for speed, acceleration, and condition
