/* - Program to Generate a Random Number and compare Guesses from User -
 --- Write a program that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive. The 
program prompts the user to enter a number. Then the program tells the user whether the 
number is too low, too high or correct
-----
Inform the user of the rules of the program
Create a scanner for the user's guess
Create a Random Object (inspired from java T point: https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-generate-random-number-in-java)
Use the Random Object to generate a random int number bet 0-100 (inclusive) and assign it to a number variable
Check if the guess is valid (bet 0-100 inclusive):
    If so:
        Check if the guess is not correct:
            If so:
                Check if the guess is larger than the number:
                    If so:
                        Return 'Too High'
                    If not:
                        Return 'Too Low'
            If not:
                Return 'Correct'
    If not:
        Return Error message
