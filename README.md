Basic Java Skills

p0_area_vol.java:<br>
Area & Volume Calculator - p0_area_vol.java:<br>
A program that takes a radius and a length of a cylinder and computes its area and volume, which
it returns to the user.

p01_pop_calc.java:<br>
Future Population Calculator<br>
A program to take a user given number of years and return the population after that number of years.
The program assumes the current population is 312,032,486.

p02_x_y_distance.java:<br>
X & Y Distance<br>
A program to takes two Xs and Ys from a user and calculates the distance between the two points.

p03_tri_perimeter.java:<br>
Triangle Perimeter Calculator<br>
A program to takes three length of sides of a triangle from a user and calculates the perimeter of that
triangle (if it is possible).

p04_area_pentagon.java:<br>
Area of a Pentagon Calculator<br>
A program to takes the length from the center to the vertex of a pentagon from a user and calculates the area
of the pentagon.  The user input must be valid.

p05_runway_calc.java:<br>
Minimum Runway Calculator<br>
A program to takes a Speed, Accelaration, and the Weather Condition from a user. The Speed and Accelaration
must be a number.  The weather condition will be either wet ('w' or 'W') or dry ('d' or 'D').  The program
then calculated the minimum runway needed for a plane to take-off and returns it to the user.
