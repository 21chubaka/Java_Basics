Basic Java Skills

Area & Volume Calculator<br>
p0_area_vol.java:<br>
A program that takes a radius and a length of a cylinder and computes its area and volume, which
it returns to the user.

Future Population Calculator<br>
p01_pop_calc.java:<br>
A program to take a user given number of years and return the population after that number of years.
The program assumes the current population is 312,032,486.

X & Y Distance<br>
p02_x_y_distance.java:<br>
A program to takes two Xs and Ys from a user and calculates the distance between the two points.

Triangle Perimeter Calculator<br>
p03_tri_perimeter.java:<br>
A program to takes three length of sides of a triangle from a user and calculates the perimeter of that
triangle (if it is possible).

Area of a Pentagon Calculator<br>
p04_area_pentagon.java:<br>
A program to takes the length from the center to the vertex of a pentagon from a user and calculates the area
of the pentagon.  The user input must be valid.

Minimum Runway Calculator<br>
p05_runway_calc.java:<br>
A program to takes a Speed, Accelaration, and the Weather Condition from a user. The Speed and Accelaration
must be a number.  The weather condition will be either wet ('w' or 'W') or dry ('d' or 'D').  The program
then calculated the minimum runway needed for a plane to take-off and returns it to the user.
