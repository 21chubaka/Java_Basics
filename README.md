Basic Java Skills

Area & Volume Calculator<br>
p0_area_vol.java:<br>
A program that takes a radius and a length of a cylinder and computes its area and volume, which
it returns to the user.

Future Population Calculator<br>
p01_pop_calc.java:<br>
A program to take a user given number of years and return the population after that number of years.
The program assumes the current population is 312,032,486.

X & Y Distance<br>
p02_x_y_distance.java:<br>
A program to take two Xs and Ys from a user and calculates the distance between the two points.

Triangle Perimeter Calculator<br>
p03_tri_perimeter.java:<br>
A program to take three length of sides of a triangle from a user and calculates the perimeter of that
triangle (if it is possible).

Area of a Pentagon Calculator<br>
p04_area_pentagon.java:<br>
A program to take the length from the center to the vertex of a pentagon from a user and calculates the area
of the pentagon.  The user input must be valid.

Minimum Runway Calculator<br>
p05_runway_calc.java:<br>
A program to take a Speed, Accelaration, and the Weather Condition from a user. The Speed and Accelaration
must be a number.  The weather condition will be either wet ('w' or 'W') or dry ('d' or 'D').  The program
then calculated the minimum runway needed for a plane to take-off and returns it to the user.

Chinese Zodiac<br>
p06_chinese_zodiac.java:<br>
A program to take a user year of birth and returns their Chinese Zodiac Animal.

Number of Days in a Month<br>
p07_day_num.java:<br>
A program to take a year and a month as an integer from the user and returns how many days are/were in that month.

Vowels & Consonants<br>
p08_vowel_cons.java:<br>
A program to take a string from a user and returns the number of the vowels and consonants.

Reverse the String<br>
p09_rev_str.java:<br>
A program to take a string from a user and returns the reverse of the string.

Cypher<br>
p10_cypher.java:<br>
A program to take a string from a user and returns the cypher string.

Common Suffixes<br>
p11_commmon_suf.java:<br>
A program to take two strings from a user and returns the common suffixes from the two strings in reverse.

Guess a Number<br>
p12_guess_num.java:<br>
A program that randomly generates an integer and asks the user to guess the number.  It tells of the user was
right, too high, or too low.  For this program the user only gets one guess.

Is an Array Sorted<br>
p13_sorted_arr.java:<br>
A program that takes a series of integers from a user and tells the user if it is sorted or not.

Has Four Consecutive Integers<br>
p14_four_con_ints.java:<br>
A program that takes a series of integers from a user and tells the user if the elements are four consecutive integers.

Max Value of 2-D Array<br>
p15_maxVal_2dArr.java:<br>
A program that determines the max value of a randomly generated 2-D Array.

Markov Matrix<br>
p16_markov_matrix.java:<br>
A program that determines if a Matrix is a Markov Matrix.

Hangman Game<br>
p17_hangman.java:<br>
A program to play Hangman.  The program randomly chooses a word and the user can continue to guess letters.  If the user
is able to guess the word, the program then returns how many wrong letters they guesses.
